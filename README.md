# Customer-Churn-Prediction



Customer churn, also known as **customer attrition**, refers to the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company over a given period. It is a key metric for businesses, especially in subscription-based models, telecommunications, banking, e-commerce, and SaaS (Software as a Service) industries.  

## Types of Customer Churn  

- **Voluntary Churn** – When customers actively decide to leave due to dissatisfaction, better alternatives, or changing needs.  
- **Involuntary Churn** – When customers are lost due to reasons beyond their control, such as payment failures or expired credit cards.  



## Why Is Customer Churn Important?  

- **Revenue Impact:** Losing customers means losing revenue, which affects business growth.  
- **Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC):** It is usually more expensive to acquire new customers than to retain existing ones.  
- **Brand Reputation:** High churn rates might indicate dissatisfaction and harm brand reputation.  

## Factors Leading to Customer Churn  

- Poor customer service  
- High pricing or lack of value for money  
- Better competitors in the market  
- Poor product experience or performance  
- Lack of engagement or communication with customers
